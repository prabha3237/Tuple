def calculate_factorial(n):
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial
numbers = input().split()
number_tuple = tuple(int(num) for num in numbers)
x = int(input())
count = number_tuple.count(x)
factorial_value = calculate_factorial(count)
print(factorial_value)
